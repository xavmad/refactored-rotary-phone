    <p><strong>Open House</strong></p>
    <p>Open House for Pitch Music and Arts Festival 2024 was a house without a door. Visitors broke in through the windows to access the festival’s communal living room for a slice of home.</p>
    <p>During the festival, it offered a space for people to appropriate. Protruding window volumes acted as rooms, benches nested within the main structure became private nooks and a sand island in the main living space offered a multiplicity of uses. So whether visitors were in the mood to sleep, dance, or just relax - they could find a window, claim their spot, and enjoy the space!</p>
    <p>As a place for communal gathering, it was exciting to see the number of ways people made Open House come to life. From belly slides, dance jungles, charades and house parties - Open House became more than we could have imagined.</p>
